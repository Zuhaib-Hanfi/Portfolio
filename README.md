# My Portfolio Website
My Portfolio website for Coder Army: Nexus course HTML CSS challenge

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my eduction, about me, and skills in web development.

## Features:-

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes animations and hover effects.
- **Contact Form**: Allows visitors to get in touch with me directly from the site.

## Note:-

I haven't use **On Scroll Animation** because it requires JS and which is porhibited to use in this competition, we can do this by using CSS Feature **animation-timeline:view();** but some browsers doesn't support it and *view()* is not a standard CSS feature so it is not recommended.
**In order to see the animation of particular sections you have to navigate to that section and refresh the website**.

## Technologies Used:-

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **GitHub Pages**

## Setup Instructions:-

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zuhaib-hanfi/portfolio.git
